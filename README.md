# High-Quality Novel View Synthesis from Noisy Images

## Installation
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bo1230/NVS-from-NI.git 
cd NVS-from-NI
```

The code is tested with Python3.10, PyTorch==2.1.2+cu118 and cudatoolkit=11.8. To create a conda environment:
```
conda create â€“n NI python=3.10
conda activate NI
conda install pytorch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
For different platforms, the pytorch installation will probably be different.
